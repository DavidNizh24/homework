     was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue

     Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and 
     industrialist who resides in Gotham City. Batman's origin story features him swearing 
     vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents, Thomas and Martha,
      as a child, a vendetta tempered with the ideal of justice. He trains himself physically and 
      intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors the Gotham streets at night. Kane,
       Finger, and other creators accompanied Batman with supporting characters, including his sidekicks
        Robin and Batgirl; allies Alfred Pennyworth, James Gordon, and love interest Catwoman; 
    and foes such as the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, and his archenemy, the Joker.

     <h1>Magneto</h1>

    <p>Magneto birth name: Max Eisenhardt; alias: Erik
        Lehnsherr[needs IPA] and Magnus is a character appearing in
         American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in 
         association with the X-Men. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer
          Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in The X-Men #1 
          (cover-dated September 1963) as an adversary of the X-Men.

        Magneto is a powerful mutant, one of a fictional subspecies 
        of humanity born with superhuman abilities, who has the ability t
        o generate and control magnetic fields. Magneto regards mutants
         as evolutionarily superior to humans and rejects the possibility 
         of peaceful human-mutant coexistence; he initially aimed to conquer 
         the world to enable mutants, whom he refers to as Homo superior,
         to replace humans as the dominant species.

      <h1>Joker</h1>

     <p>The Joker is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by
         DC Comics. Created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson, the character 
         first appeared in the debut issue of the comic book Batman on April 25, 1940. 
         Credit for the Joker's creation is disputed; Kane and Robinson claimed responsibility
          for his design while acknowledging Finger's writing contribution. Although the Joker
           was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial 
           intervention, allowing 
        the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero Batman.
